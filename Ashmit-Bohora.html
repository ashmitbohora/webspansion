                    <h3><i class="fa fa-user"></i>Hi, I'm Ashmit Bohora! </h3>
                    <p>I'm a high school senior based in Texas, USA, and the proud creator of Webspansion. My journey into coding started in early years of high school, but I really fell in love with building websites during my junior and senior years.</p>
                    <p>Webspansion is my way of combining two things I love: coding and helping others. <strong> My goal is simple: to create free, reliable, and visually stunning websites for businesses, nonprofits, and anyone in need. </strong>Through this journey, I hope to grow as a designer and developer while making a difference for people who want to get noticed online.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-laptop-code"></i>How It All Began</h3>
                    <p>My love for coding started with a simple dream: building a basic Roblox obby game. While that didn't work out, it opened the door to learning Java. Eventually, though, I discovered my true passion in HTML and CSS—languages that let me bring creative ideas to life.</p>
                    <p>I started building websites just for fun, recreating popular brands like McDonald's, Popeyes, and Burger King. I learned everything on my own, mostly through YouTube tutorials. I still laugh when I think about my first attempt to recreate the Popeyes website—it was far from perfect and took multiple tries just to make it look decent! But that experience taught me a lot, and looking back now, I can see how much I've grown.</p>

                <div class="section3-text sectionText">
                    <h3><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>The Birth of Webspansion</h3>
                    <p>• As I improved my coding skills, I wanted to take on a bigger challenge, something meaningful. That's when I created Webspansion. It's not just about websites—it's about giving back to the community that helped me become who I am today.</p>
                    <p>• The first big project for Webspansion is Project 100, where I aim to create 100 free websites. So far, I've completed x out of 100, and every new website teaches me something valuable about the digital world and working with real clients.</p>
                    <p><strong>People often ask me, “Why are your services free?” </strong><br> • My answer is simple: I gain more than I give. Webspansion gives me real-world experience—working on projects, solving problems, and interacting with clients. This is the best way for me to learn and prepare for future opportunities. Plus, by offering my services for free, I can help more people and businesses who might not otherwise have access to a professional website.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fa fa-utensils"></i>Outside of Webspansion</h3>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me enjoying my favorite foods—especially momo, a Nepali dumpling that I can never get enough of! I also love playing sports with friends and spending meaningful time with my family. These moments give me balance and remind me why I started Webspansion in the first place: to create something that helps others while staying true to who I am.</p>
